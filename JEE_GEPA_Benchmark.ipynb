Think step-by-step and be extremely careful with algebraic manipulations, substitutions, and applying formulas.\\n    *   **Double-check your work for common pitfalls.** For example:\\n        *   **Trigonometry:** Remember that `sqrt(x^2) = |x|`.

Pay close attention to the principal value ranges of inverse trigonometric functions.\\n        *   **Calculus:** When evaluating definite integrals over symmetric intervals (like `[-a, a]`), check if the integrand has even/odd properties or other symmetries (`f(x) + f(-x)`).

Then, evaluate the function at the endpoints. The range is `[min(f(a), f(b)), max(f(a), f(b))]`. In a problem where the range is given as `[α, β]`, `α` is the minimum value and `β` is the maximum value.\\n        *   **Probability:** Be precise in defining events and applying formulas like Bayes' theorem. Ensure prior probabilities (e.g., P(lost card is a spade) = 13/52) and posterior probabilities are not confused. Simplify combinatorial expressions carefully.\\n        *   **Geometry:** Leverage known theorems.

Functions and Calculus:**\\n*   **For `max{...}` or `min{...}` functions:** The points of interest for continuity and differentiability are where the constituent functions are equal (e.g., `f(x) = g(x)`).\\n    *   First, solve for these \"crossover\" points (e.g., `x, x^3, ...` are all equal at `x = -1, 0, 1`).\\n    *   Then, determine which function is the maximum/minimum on the intervals *between* these points.\\n    *   Finally, check the limits and derivatives at the crossover points to determine continuity and differentiability.\\n\\n**2. Coordinate Geometry (Conic Sections):**\\n*   **Focal Chords of a Parabola:** For a parabola like `y^2 = 4ax`, if a focal chord connects points with parameters `t_1` and `t_2` (where a point is `(at^2, 2at)`), then the key property is `t_1 * t_2 = -1`. Using this parametric approach is often far simpler and more reliable than working with the Cartesian equation of the chord.\\n\\n**3. Algebra and Trigonometry:**\\n*   **Expression Simplification:** When asked to evaluate a complex expression involving variables defined by trigonometric functions (e.g., `y = cos(arccos(x) + C)`), do not rush into brute-force substitution.\\n    *   First, try to rearrange the initial definition to find a simpler, implicit polynomial relationship between the variables (e.g., manipulate `4y = x - ...` and square both sides to get a clean equation like `4x^2 - 8xy + 16y^2 = 12`). The target expression is often a factor or a multiple of this implicit relation.\\n\\n**4. Complex Numbers and Sequences (Roots of Unity):**\\n*   **Periodic Sums:** When summing terms involving roots of unity (e.g., `α` where `α^2 + α + 1 = 0`, so `α^3 = 1`), exploit their periodic nature.\\n    *   **Step 1:** Calculate the value of the summand for the first few `k` (e.g., `k=1, 2, 3`).\\n    *   **Step 2:** Identify the period of the sequence of terms. For cube roots of unity, the period is 3.\\n    *   **Step 3:** Calculate the sum of the terms over one full period. (e.g., `Sum_{k=1 to 3} (...) = 6`).\\n    *   **Step 4:** To find the sum up to `n`, use the periodic sum. For example, if the sum is `S`, and you need to find `n` such that `Sum = 20`, express `n` as `n = 3q + r` and solve `S_n = q * (Sum over period) + S_r = 20`. This is more robust than using geometric series formulas on the components.\\n\\n**5. Systems of Linear Equations:**\\n*   **Infinite Solutions:** For a system to have infinitely many solutions, the coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix must have the same rank, and this rank must be less than the number of variables. This can be verified by reducing the augmented matrix to row echelon form and ensuring a row of zeros in the coefficient part is matched by a zero in the constant part (i.e., you derive an identity like `0 = 0`).',\n",

It is often better to first use the property `∫[0, 2a] f(x)dx = 2∫[0, a] f(x)dx` (if `f(2a-x)=f(x)`) to change the interval to `[0, π/2]` before making the substitution.\\n*   **Ellipse Focal Radii:** Be precise with ellipse properties. The **sum** of the focal distances (`SP + S\\'P`) is constant and equals `2a`. The **product** of the focal distances (`SP · S\\'P`) is **not** constant; it is given by the expression `a² - e²x²` and its value depends on the position of the point `P`. To find its minimum or maximum, you must analyze this expression over the valid range of `x`.\\n*   **Conditional Probability:** For problems asking for a \"reverse\" probability (e.g., given that event B occurred, what is the probability of event A?), Bayes\\' Theorem is almost always the correct approach. Clearly define your events and use the Law of Total Probability to compute the denominator.',\n",

Examples include:\\n    *   **Calculus:** King's Property for definite integrals (`∫f(x)dx = ∫f(a+b-x)dx`), substitution rules, integration by parts, properties of even/odd functions.\\n    *   **Coordinate Geometry:** The distance formula from a point to a line, the section formula, properties of tangents, the fact that the point of tangency of two circles lies on the line connecting their centers.\\n    *   **Algebra:** Vieta's formulas, properties of determinants, the rational root theorem.\\n    *   **Vectors:** Properties of dot and cross products, scalar triple product, representation of a vector in a plane using a linear combination of two non-collinear vectors.\\n    *   **Probability:** The Law of Total Probability, Bayes' Theorem, definitions of conditional probability.\\n\\n**2. `### answer`**\\n\\n*   **Content:** This section must contain **only** the final, simplified answer.\\n*   **Format:** The answer must be an exact value. Do not include any extra text, labels, or formatting like `The final answer is...` or `boxed` environments.\\n    *   **Numbers:** Provide rational numbers as a simplified integer or a fraction (e.g., `80`, `19/21`, `-3/2`). Do not use decimal approximations (e.g., use `1/4`, not `0.25`).\\n    *   **Expressions with Radicals:** Simplify radicals as much as possible (e.g., `√8` should be `2√2`). If a radical is in the denominator, rationalize it (e.g., `1/√2` should be `√2/2`).\\n    *   **Vectors:** Present vectors by factoring out any common scalar. For example, `-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\hat{i} + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\hat{k}` should be written as `\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(-\\\\hat{i} + \\\\hat{k})` or `\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}(-\\\\hat{i} + \\\\hat{k})`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Crucial Strategies & Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**\\n\\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** A common error is to solve for an intermediate variable (like the total number of terms in a sequence) and report it as the answer, when the question asks for a more specific quantity (like the number of *integer* terms). Always double-check what you are being asked to find.\\n*   **Ellipse Properties:** Be precise with ellipse properties. The **sum** of the focal distances (`SP + S'P`) is constant and equals `2a`. The smallest circle enclosing an ellipse is its circumcircle, with radius `a` (the semi-major axis).\\n*   **Foot of a Perpendicular:** For problems asking for the foot of a perpendicular from a point `P` to a line `L`, or distances involving it, remember that calculating the coordinates of the foot can be computationally intensive. Consider more efficient methods:\\n    *   The distance from `P` to `L` can be found directly with the distance formula.\\n    *   If a triangle is formed, it is often a right-angled triangle, allowing the use of the Pythagorean theorem.\\n*   **Integrals with `⌊x⌋` or `⌊x²⌋`:** When evaluating definite integrals of the greatest integer function, be sure to split the integral at every point where the argument of the function becomes an integer. For example, for `∫⌊x²⌋dx`, you must split the integral at `x=1, √2, √3, 2, ...`.\",\n",

      "    *   **Double-check your work for common pitfalls.** For example:\n",
      "        *   **Trigonometry:** Remember that `sqrt(x^2) = |x|`. Be mindful of the signs of trigonometric functions in different quadrants (e.g., `cos(2)` is negative since 2 radians is in the second quadrant). Pay close attention to the principal value ranges of inverse trigonometric functions.\n",

      "        *   **Functions:** To find the range of a continuous function on a closed interval `[a, b]`, a robust method is to first check for monotonicity (e.g., via the derivative). Then, evaluate the function at the endpoints. The range is `[min(f(a), f(b)), max(f(a), f(b))]`. In a problem where the range is given as `[α, β]`, `α` is the minimum value and `β` is the maximum value.\n",

      "        *   **Geometry:** Leverage known theorems. For instance, the maximum area of a parallelogram inscribed in a triangle, sharing one vertex with the triangle, is exactly half the area of the triangle.\n",

      "**Task Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Analyze and Solve:**\n",
      "    *   Read the problem meticulously. Identify the mathematical domain (e.g., calculus, trigonometry, algebra, probability, geometry).\n",
      "    *   Select the most effective strategy. Think step-by-step and be extremely careful with algebraic manipulations, substitutions, and applying formulas.\n",
      "    *   **Double-check your work for common pitfalls.** For example:\n",
      "        *   **Trigonometry:** Remember that `sqrt(x^2) = |x|`. Be mindful of the signs of trigonometric functions in different quadrants (e.g., `cos(2)` is negative since 2 radians is in the second quadrant). Pay close attention to the principal value ranges of inverse trigonometric functions.\n",
      "        *   **Calculus:** When evaluating definite integrals over symmetric intervals (like `[-a, a]`), check if the integrand has even/odd properties or other symmetries (`f(x) + f(-x)`). Try to simplify the integrand algebraically *before* integrating, as this is often less error-prone than applying substitutions to a complex expression.\n",
      "        *   **Functions:** To find the range of a continuous function on a closed interval `[a, b]`, a robust method is to first check for monotonicity (e.g., via the derivative). Then, evaluate the function at the endpoints. The range is `[min(f(a), f(b)), max(f(a), f(b))]`. In a problem where the range is given as `[α, β]`, `α` is the minimum value and `β` is the maximum value.\n",
      "        *   **Probability:** Be precise in defining events and applying formulas like Bayes' theorem. Ensure prior probabilities (e.g., P(lost card is a spade) = 13/52) and posterior probabilities are not confused. Simplify combinatorial expressions carefully.\n",
      "        *   **Geometry:** Leverage known theorems. For instance, the maximum area of a parallelogram inscribed in a triangle, sharing one vertex with the triangle, is exactly half the area of the triangle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Format the Output:**\n",
      "    *   Your entire response must consist of exactly two sections, in this specific order:\n",

      "    *   Start by stating the key concepts, formulas, or theorems you will use.\n",
      "    *   Lay out the logical steps of your derivation. Explain each significant step clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **`### answer`**:\n",
      "    *   This section must contain **only** the final answer.\n",
      "    *   The answer must be an exact value (not a decimal approximation like `3.14`).\n",
      "    *   If the answer is a number, provide it as a simplified integer or a fraction in its simplest form (e.g., `5`, `1/4`, `-3/2`, `7/3`).\n",
      "    *   If the answer involves constants like `π`, leave them as they are (e.g., `π - 5/4`).\n",

      "*   **Limits with Indeterminate Forms:** For limits of the form `f(x)/x^n` as `x→0`, using Taylor series expansions for functions like `cos(x)`, `sin(x)`, and `e^x` is often more robust than repeated L'Hôpital's Rule. For the limit to be finite, the coefficients of all terms in the numerator's expansion with degree less than `n` must be zero.\n",
      "*   **Complex Numbers:** If a problem states that `|z|=1`, the identity `z * z̅ = |z|² = 1` (and thus `z̅ = 1/z`) is a powerful tool for simplification.\n",
      "*   **Analytic Geometry / Conic Sections:**\n",
      "    *   **Shortest Distance:** The shortest distance between two differentiable curves is measured along their common normal. For finding the shortest distance between a curve and a circle, a common method is to find the point on the curve that is closest to the circle's center and then subtract the circle's radius.\n",

First, rewrite the integral as `e^{-x}∫[0,x] e^t f(t)dt`. Then, multiply the entire equation by `e^x` to clear the `e^{-x}` term.

It is often better to first use the property `∫[0, 2a] f(x)dx = 2∫[0, a] f(x)dx` (if `f(2a-x)=f(x)`) to change the interval to `[0, π/2]` before making the substitution.\n",

      "**Crucial Strategies & Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Algebraic Meticulousness:** A simple error in algebra can invalidate the entire solution. Be extremely careful with operations like polynomial division. For example, in a differential equation, an error like incorrectly simplifying `5x⁴ / (5x)` to `x²` instead of `x³` will lead to a completely wrong function.\n",
      "*   **Contradictory Premises:** If the problem's given conditions lead to a mathematical contradiction (e.g., a vector must be orthogonal to another, but their dot product is non-zero), you must state this contradiction clearly. Do not attempt to force a solution by making an invalid assumption.\n",
      "*   **Finding the Elegant Path:** Before committing to a lengthy, brute-force calculation (e.g., expanding a complex cross product), consider if a more elegant method exists. For the area of a triangle ABC, `Area = (1/2) |AB| |AC| sin(θ)` is often simpler than `(1/2) |AB x AC|` if the angle `θ` is easy to find.\n",
      "*   **Integral Equations:** For problems involving an equation with an integral like `∫[a, x] f(t) dt = g(x, f(x))`, the standard strategy is:\n",
      "    1.  Differentiate both sides with respect to `x` using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n",
      "    2.  Solve the resulting differential equation for `f(x)`.\n",
      "    3.  Use the initial condition, often found by setting `x=a` in the original equation (which makes the integral zero), to find the constant of integration.\n",
      "*   **Combinatorics:** When solving counting problems with multiple conditions, clearly state your strategy (e.g., Casework, Complementary Counting). If using casework, ensure your cases are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n",
      "*   **Information Relevance:** In multi-part geometry or algebra problems, learn to identify which pieces of information are essential for each step. Sometimes, information (like the specific equation of a curve) is provided but not needed for an intermediate calculation (like finding coordinates based on midpoint and distance properties).\n",
      "*   **Vector Logic:** Be precise with vector properties. For an equation like `a x c = b x d`, remember this implies `(a x c)` is orthogonal to `b`. Always check if this condition holds with the given vectors. If `(a x c) · b ≠ 0`, the problem statement is inconsistent (unless a relevant vector or scalar is zero).\n"
